The :file:`technote.toml` file contains metadata about the technote, along with configuration options for the Sphinx build.
This page describes the schema for this file.

   If you are not familiar with TOML, see the `TOML documentation <https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0>`_.

.. _toml-technote:

The ``[technote]`` table is the root table for technote metadata and configuration in the :file:`technote.toml` file.

.. _toml-technote-id:

id
--

|optional|

An internal identifier for the technote.

.. code-block:: toml

   [technote]
   id = "SQR-001"

.. see also::

   :ref:`toml-technote-series-id`

.. _toml-technote-series-id:

series_id
---------

|optional|

An internal identifier for a series or collection this technote belongs to.

.. code-block:: toml

   [technote]
   id = "SQR-001"

.. see also::

   :ref:`toml-technote-id`

.. _toml-technote-organization:

organization
------------

|optional|

The organization that publishes the technote series.
The value is a table with the same structure as :ref:`toml-technote-authors-affiliations`.

.. _toml-technote-title:

title
-----

|optional|

The title of the technote.
Use this metadata field to override the title in the content.
Generally this metadata *should not* be set in :file:`technote.toml` if the document title in content file is correct.

.. _toml-technote-date-created:

date_created
------------

|optional|

Date and time when the technote was created.
This should be set as an :rfc:`3339` (i.e., ISO8601) string.
Either as a date (``YYYY-MM-DD``) or a date and time with a timezone (``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ``).

TOML treats dates and date-times as native types, and therefore don't use quotes:

.. code-block:: toml

   [technote]
   date_modified = 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z


.. _toml-technote-date-modified:

date_modified

|optional|

Date and time when the technote was last updated.
This should be set as an ISO8601 string.
This should be set as an :rfc:`3339` (i.e., ISO8601) string.
Either as a date (``YYYY-MM-DD``) or a date and time with a timezone (``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ``).

TOML treats dates and date-times as native types, and therefore don't use quotes:

   [technote]
   date_modified = 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z

The version of the technote.

.. _toml-technote-doi:

The default branch of the GitHub repository.

.. _toml-technote-authors:

[[technote.authors]]
====================

Authors are specified as an array of tables.
In :file:`technote.toml`, this means that each author is described with their own ``[[technote.authors]]`` table.
You can have as many ``[[technote.authors]]`` tables as you need.

.. _toml-technote-authors-name:

name
----

|required|

The author's name, as it should appear in the technote:

.. _toml-technote-authors-affiliations:

[[technote.authors.affiliations]]
=================================

|optional|

An author can have multiple affiliations.
Each affiliation is a table in the ``[[technote.authors.affiliations]]`` array.

.. code-block:: toml

   [technote.authors]
   name.given = "Vera C."
   name.family = "Rubin"
   affiliations = [
     { name = "Department of Astronomy, University of Washington" },
     { name = "Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Carnegie Institution of Washington" }
   ]

The above example used inline tables for each affiliation.
If each affiliation has a large amount of metadata you can instead use the array of table TOML syntax:

.. code-block:: toml

   [technote.authors]
   name.given = "Vera C."
   name.family = "Rubin"
   [[technote.authors.affiliations]]
   name = "Department of Astronomy, University of Washington"
