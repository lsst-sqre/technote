### New features

- Code samples without captions (unwrapped `.highlight` divs) now have borders and are protected against x-overflow. This matches the behavior of code samples with captions.
- All code samples have negative left margin equal to their content padding so that the code lines up with the text column.
- The content (`div.sb-container`) now has bottom margin to give content breathing room.
