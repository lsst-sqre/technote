### New features

- Light and dark colour themes are now set via a `html[data-theme='light']` or `dark` data theme attribute. JavaScript sets this element based on the user preference of 'light', 'dark', or 'auto' (using media queries for system settings). New CSS classes `technote-themed-light` and `technote-themed-dark` now determine what elements appear, or not, in certain themed contexts. This mechanism is highly inspired by pydata-sphinx-theme.
- Pygments highlighting CSS is now applied to all code samples, with light and dark themes using the mechanism described above. The default pygments styling comes from the `accessible-pygments` package. The mechanism for setting a light and dark Pygments theme is also based on pydata-sphinx-theme.
- New CSS custom properties for setting light and dark responsive colours.
