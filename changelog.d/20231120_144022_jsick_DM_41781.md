### Backwards-incompatible changes

- New structure for the `PersonName` model (used for the name key in  `[[technote.authors]]`):

  - Delete the `name` key to require structured names
  - Rename the `given_names` and `family_names` keys to `given` and `family`, respectively, which works better in context.

### New features

- Add a new `organization` key to the `[technote]` table to capture information about the organization publishing the technote series.
