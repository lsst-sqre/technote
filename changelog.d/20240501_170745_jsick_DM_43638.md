### New features

- Changed how the base font size is set. The base font size on the `html` element is now 100% to explicitly respect the user's settings. The `rem` unit is now relative to those user settings as well.
- The "default" font size is now set on the `body` element with the `--tn-component-text-font-size` CSS property. This is set to `1.1rem` by default to maintain the original look. The header sizes are now relative to the user font size, but the smaller sizes have been increased slightly.
- The font size for `code` is now set to `0.9em`. This slightly smaller size helps avoid a baseline misalignment issue for the monospace text in the paragraph.
- The `pre` font size is `1rem`, which is slightly smaller than the text font size.
- New `--tn-component-code-font-family` CSS property. This is used for monospace fonts in code blocks and inline code. The default is `ui-monospace`, which gives SF Mono on macOS.

### Bug fixes

### Other changes

- Pin `pytest < 8.0` due to a change in test sessions that's incompatible with running a technote Sphinx build repeatedly on different projects. This change is temporary until we update the project builder for tests to run in subprocesses for isolation.
