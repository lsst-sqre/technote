### Backwards-incompatible changes

- The `technote.status` field is changed. The "planning" and "active" states are now "draft." The values in the `supersceding_urls` array are now tables with `url` and `title` (optional) keys.

### New features

- The new "insertstatus" Sphinx extension, included in the `technote.ext` Sphinx extension, inserts an aside element below the title of the technote describing the status. The status is only published for non-stable states.
