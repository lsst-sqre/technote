### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Refactor the original `technote.config` module into separate modules and classes for modeling `technote.toml` settings, internal representation of metadata (`technote.metadata.model.TechnoteMetadata`), the front-end for bootstrapping the Sphinx configuration in `conf.py` (`technote.main.TechnoteSphinxConfig`), and the Jinja context for HTML templating (`technote.templating.context.TechnoteJinjaContext`). A new factory class is responsible for creating these objects (`technote.factory.TechnoteFactory`). The benefit of this architecture is that it's not possible to continue building metadata from additional sources (external APIs and the technote context) since the metadata is not longer strictly tied to the `technote.toml` file representation.
