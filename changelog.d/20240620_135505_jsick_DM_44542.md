### New features

- Technote now features a two-column layout. The left column contains the table of contents and metadata, while the right column contains the content. This layout allows for wide content to "bleed" into the whitespace to the right of the content column. With this change, we've essentially dropped the CSS patterns from the `sphinx-basic-ng` theme. The Technote layout is now built around CSS grid.

- Wide content (such as figures, tables, and code blocks) can now extend past the content column if the author sets the `technote-wide-content` class on the content. This class is applied as a `figclass` option in figures or as a preceeding `rst-class` directive to tables and code blocks.
